# Sim.-Oscilloscope
A project for my Software Engineering class, simulating an oscilloscope

Required Modules to run latest version (2.0)
1. pyaudio
2. openpyxl
3. numpy
4. pandas
5. mtplotlib

Description
Current version (2.0) creates a seperate Excel file named audioData.xlsx and records your voice or sound input from
headset. Volume of voice is recorded onto Excel file over 1000 iterations (about 28 seconds long) and generates
graph from collected data of change in volume over time.
Program can be ended early through Ctrl+C, and will generate a graph based on collected data before early termination.
Program will begin the moment it's activated. Recommended that you run program through IDLE or Visual Basic rather than
clicking on the icon itself.
